# Phising-Website-Detection
The availability of multiple services such as online banking, entertainment, education, software downloading, and social networking has accelerated the Web's evolution in recent years. As a result, a massive amount of data is constantly downloaded and transferred to the Internet. This allows attackers to access sensitive personal or financial data such as usernames, passwords, account numbers, and social security numbers. This is known as a Web phishing attack, and it is one of the most serious issues in web security. In a Web phishing attack, the attacker creates phishing websites that look similar to real websites in order to trick Web users and get their sensitive financial and personal information. The phishing attack begins with the victim clicking on a link contained in an email. Victims will receive an email with a link to update or validate their personal information. The Web browser will send the target victims to a phishing website that looks similar to the original website if they click this link. Because web users are asked to input critical information on the phishing website, attackers can steal important information from them.
